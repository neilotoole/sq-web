`sq` implements a [jq ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)-style query language, formally
known as [`SLQ`](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq/tree/master/grammar).

Behind the scenes, all `sq` queries execute against a SQL database. This is true even for
[document sources](/docs/concepts#document-source) such as [CSV](/docs/drivers/csv)
or [XLSX](/docs/drivers/xlsx). For those document
sources, `sq` loads the source data into a [scratch database](/docs/concepts#scratch-db),
and executes the query against that database.

{{< alert icon="👉" >}}
Because it's all SQL behind the scenes, you can always bypass `sq`'s query language
and execute database-native SQL queries using the [`sq sql`](/docs/cmd/sql) command.
{{< /alert >}}


## Fundamentals

Let's take a look at a query that shows the main elements.

```shell
$ sq '@sakila_pg | .actor | where(.actor_id < 10) | .first_name | .[0:3]'
first_name  last_name
PENELOPE    GUINESS
NICK        WAHLBERG
ED          CHASE
```

You can probably guess what's going on above. This query has 5 _segments_:

| Handle       | Table    | Filter                  | Column(s)                 | Row Range |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| `@sakila_pg` | `.actor` | `where(.actor_id < 10)` | `.first_name, .last_name` | `.[0:3]`  |

Ultimately the SLQ query is translated to a SQL query, which is executed
against the `@sakila_pg` source (which in this example is a [Postgres](/docs/drivers/postgres)
database). The generated SQL query will look something like:

```sql
SELECT "first_name", "last_name" FROM "actor"
WHERE "actor_id" < 10
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 0
```

## Shorthand

For a single-table query, you can concatenate the handle and table name.
In this example, we list all the rows of the `actor` table.

```shell
# Longhand
$ sq '@sakila_pg | .actor'

# Shorthand
$ sq '@sakila_pg.actor'
```

If the query only has a single segment and doesn't contain any shell delimiters
or control chars, you can omit the quotes:

```shell
$ sq @sakila_pg.actor
```

If the query is against the [active source](/docs/cmd/src), then you don't even
need to specify the handle.

```shell
$ sq .actor
```

## Filter results (`where`)

Use the `where()` mechanism to filter results.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | .first_name, .last_name | where(.first_name == "TOM")'
first_name  last_name
TOM         MCKELLEN
TOM         MIRANDA
```

Ultimately a filter is translated into a SQL `WHERE` clause such as:

```sql
SELECT "first_name", "last_name" FROM "actor" WHERE "first_name" = "TOM"
```

{{< alert icon="👉" >}}
For interoperability with jq, you can use the
[`select()`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/v1.6/#select(boolean_expression))
synonym:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | select(.first_name == "TOM")'
```

For discussion of `where()` vs `select()`, see this [issue](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq/issues/254).
{{< /alert >}}


## Operators

The typical comparison operators are available in expressions:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | where(.actor_id < 3)'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update
1         PENELOPE    GUINESS    2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
2         NICK        WAHLBERG   2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
```

| Operator | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                 |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |

You can use boolean operators (`&&`, `||`) to combine expressions.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | where(.actor_id <= 2 || .actor_id == 105)'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update
1         PENELOPE    GUINESS    2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
2         NICK        WAHLBERG   2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
105       SIDNEY      CROWE      2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
```

Use parentheses to group expressions.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | where(.actor_id <= 2 || (.actor_id > 100 && .first_name == "GROUCHO"))'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update
1         PENELOPE    GUINESS    2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
2         NICK        WAHLBERG   2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
106       GROUCHO     DUNST      2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
172       GROUCHO     WILLIAMS   2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
```

## Row range

You can limit the number of returned rows using the row range construct `.[x:y]`.
Note that the elements are [zero-indexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering).

```shell
$ sq '.actor | .[3]'      # Return row index 3 (fourth row)
$ sq '.actor | .[0:3]'    # Return rows 0-3
$ sq '.actor | .[:3]'     # Same as above; return rows 0-3
$ sq '.actor | .[100:]'   # Return rows 100 onwards
```

At the backend, a row range becomes a `LIMIT x OFFSET y` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "actor" LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2
```

## Column aliases

You can give an alias to a column expression using `.name:alias`.
For example:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | .first_name:given_name, .last_name:family_name'
given_name   family_name
PENELOPE     GUINESS
NICK         WAHLBERG
```

On the backend, `sq` uses the SQL `column AS alias` construct. The query
above would be rendered into SQL like this:

```sql
SELECT "first_name" AS "given_name", "last_name" AS "family_name" FROM "actor"
```

This works for any type of column expression, including functions.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | count():quantity'
quantity
200
```

It's common to alias [whitespace names](#whitespace-names):

```shell
$ sq '.actor | ."first name":first_name, ."last name":last_name'
given_name  family_name
PENELOPE    GUINESS
NICK        WAHLBERG
```

But note that the alias itself can contain whitespace if desired. Simply
enclose the alias in double quotes.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | .first_name:"First Name"'
First Name
PENELOPE
NICK
```

## Whitespace names

If a table or column name has whitespace, surround the name in quotes.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | ."first name", ."last name"'
$ sq '."film actor" | .actor_id'
```

## Select literal

You can select a literal as a column value:

```shell
# Postgres source
$ sq '.actor | .first_name, "X", .last_name'
first_name  X  last_name
PENELOPE    X  GUINESS
NICK        X  WAHLBERG
```

You may want to alias the literal column:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | .first_name, "X":middle_name, .last_name'
first_name  middle_name  last_name
PENELOPE    X            GUINESS
NICK        X            WAHLBERG
```

## Select expression

In addition to literals, you can also select expressions. If the
expression does not refer to any column or table, you can omit
the table selector, and use `sq` as a calculator.

```shell
$ sq 1+2
1+2
3
```

{{< alert icon="👉" >}}
If the query doesn't reference a handle (such as `@sakila_pg`), the
[active source](/docs/cmd/src) is used. If there's no active source,
such as immediately after a new install, `sq` falls back to using
the [scratch DB](/docs/concepts/#scratch-db) (typically SQLite).
{{< /alert >}}

Calculator mode is probably better with `--no-header` (`-H`).

```shell
$ sq -H 1 + 2 + 3
6
```

Use parentheses to groups expressions.

```shell
$ sq '(1+2)*3'
(1+2)*3
9
```

You can alias an expression if desired.

```shell
$ sq '((1+2)*3):answer'
answer
9
```

## Predefined variables

The `--arg` flag passes a value to `sq` as a predefined variable. If you
run `sq` with `--arg foo bar`, then `$foo` is available in the query and
has the value `bar`. Note that the value will be treated as a string,
so `--arg foo 123` will bind `$foo` to `"123"`.

```shell
$ sq --arg first TOM '.actor | where(.first_name == $first)'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update
38        TOM         MCKELLEN   2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
42        TOM         MIRANDA    2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
```

This is particularly useful when dealing with values that contain
whitespace, shell tokens, long strings, etc..

```shell
# Value containing single-quote
$ sq --arg last "O'Toole" '.actor | where(.last_name == $last)'

# Value containing double-quote
sq --arg first 'Elvis "The King"' '.actor | .first_name == $first'
```

It's common to combine `sq --arg` with shell variables:

```shell
$ PASSWD=`cat password.txt`
$ sq --arg pw "$PASSWD" '.secrets | where(.password == $pw)'
```

Note that you can supply multiple variables:

```shell
$ sq --arg first TOM --arg last MIRANDA '.actor | where(.first_name == $first && .last_name == $last)'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update
42        TOM         MIRANDA    2020-06-11T02:50:54Z
```

## Joins

Use the `join` construct to [join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL))
two or more tables. You can join tables in a
single data source, or across data sources. That is, you can join a Postgres table
and a CSV file, or an Excel worksheet and a JSON file, etc.

Given our Sakila dataset, let's say we want to get the names of the films
that each actor appears in. The relevant tables here are `actor`, `film_actor`,
and `film`.

In SQL, the join would look like:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, title
FROM actor a
    INNER JOIN film_actor fa ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
    INNER JOIN film f ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
```

The most terse `sq` query to express this is:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor_id) | join(.film, .film_id) | .first_name, .last_name, .title'
```
![sq join actor film_actor film using](sq_query_join_actor_film_actor_film_using.png)


The general form of a join is:

```shell
join_type(.table, predicate_expression)
```

### Join types

The usual SQL join types are supported, except `NATURAL JOIN`[^1]. Each join
type has a short form and a synonym, e.g. `fojoin` and `full_outer_join`. You can use
either form in your query.

| Join type | Synonym            | SQL                | Notes                                                              |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `join`    | `inner_join`       | `INNER JOIN`       | <small>A plain SQL `JOIN` is actually an  `INNER JOIN`</small>     |
| `ljoin`   | `left_join`        | `LEFT JOIN`        |                                                                    |
| `loj`     | `left_outer_join`  | `LEFT OUTER JOIN`  |                                                                    |
| `rjoin`   | `right_join`       | `RIGHT JOIN`       |                                                                    |
| `rojoin`  | `right_outer_join` | `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` |                                                                    |
| `fojoin`  | `full_outer_join`  | `FULL OUTER JOIN`  | <small>Not supported in [MySQL](/docs/drivers/mysql)</small>       |
| `xjoin`   | `cross_join`       | `CROSS JOIN`       | <small>Doesn't take a predicate, e.g. `xjoin(.film_actor)`</small> |

[^1]: `NATURAL JOIN` is not implemented, for several reasons. It's not universally
supported (e.g. [SQL Server](/docs/drivers/sqlserver)). It's considered an [anti-pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6039758) by some.
And in testing, it doesn't always work consistently from one DB to the other, leading to user surprise.
That said, it's possible this decision will be reconsidered based on [user feedback](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq/issues/new/choose).

### Join predicate

The join predicate is an expression that renders to the SQL `JOIN ... ON x` term.

Let's take our terse example from above.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor_id) | join(.film, .film_id) | .first_name, .last_name, .title'
```

The most explicit form of that query would be (linebreaks added for legibility):

```shell
$ sq '.actor
| join(.film_actor, .actor.actor_id == .film_actor.actor_id)
| join(.film, .film_actor.film_id == .film.film_id)
| .actor.first_name, .actor.last_name, .film.title'
```

The query above is obviously needlessly verbose.

### Table aliases

We can use _table aliases_ to make the query more legible:

```shell
$ sq '.actor:a
| join(.film_actor:fa, .a.actor_id == .fa.actor_id)
| join(.film:f, .fa.film_id == .f.film_id)
| .a.first_name, .a.last_name, .f.title'
```

Table aliases work like [column aliases](#column-aliases).

Note that table aliases aren't
restricted to join scenarios. You can generally use them anywhere you reference a table,
although it's often somewhat pointless:

```shell
# No table alias
$ sq '.actor | .first_name, .last_name'

# With table alias
$ sq '.actor:a | .a.first_name, .a.last_name'
```

### Unary join predicate

In the common case where tables are joined on equality of
identically-named columns, you can simply specify the column name.

```shell
# Explicit column equality predicate
$ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor.actor_id == .film_actor.actor_id)'

# Much better!
$ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor_id)'
```

This form is logically equivalent to SQL's `USING(col)` mechanism, although
`sq` chooses to render it using the explicit equality comparison `ON tbl1.col = tbl2.col`.

### Multiple join predicates

The join predicate is an expression, and can feature an arbitrary number
of terms. For example:

```shell
$ sq '.tbl1 | join(.tbl2, .tbl1.col1 == .tbl2.col1 && .tbl1.col2 != .tbl2.col2)'
```

This would render to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "tbl1" INNER JOIN "tbl2"
    ON "tbl1"."col1" = "tbl2"."col1"
    AND "tbl1"."col2" != "tbl2"."col2"
```

Like any `sq` expression, you can add parentheses if desired.

```shell
$ sq '.tbl1 | join(.tbl2, (.tbl1.col1 == .tbl2.col1) && (.tbl1.col2 != .tbl2.col2))'
```

### No join predicate

`CROSS JOIN` is the odd man out, in that it doesn't take a predicate.

```shell
$ sq '.film:f | xjoin(.language:l) | .f.title, .l.name'
```

### Cross-source joins

`sq` can join across two or more data sources. Given three sources:

- `@sakila/pg12` (Postgres)
- `@sakila/my8` (MySQL)
- `@sakila/ms17` (Microsoft SQL Server)

You can join them as follows:

```shell
$ sq '@sakila/pg12.actor
| join(@sakila/my8.film_actor, .actor_id)
| join(@sakila/ms17.film, .film_id)
| .first_name, .last_name, .title'
```

If there's an active source (`@sakila/pg12` in this example),
you don't need to qualify the left (first) table:

```shell
$ sq '.actor
| join(@sakila/my8.film_actor, .actor_id)
| join(@sakila/ms17.film, .film_id)
| .first_name, .last_name, .title'
```

If the handle is omitted from any join table reference, the table's
source is assumed to be that of the leftmost table.

```shell
$ sq '@sakila/pg12.actor
| join(@sakila/my8.film_actor, .actor_id)
| join(.film, .film_id)
| .first_name, .last_name, .title'
```

In the example above, the `.film` table's source is taken
to be the same as the `@sakila/pg12.actor`
table's source, i.e. `@sakila/pg12`.

With `@sakila/pg12` as the active source, this query is equivalent to the above:

```shell
$ sq '.actor
| join(@sakila/my8.film_actor, .actor_id)
| join(.film, .film_id)
| .first_name, .last_name, .title'
```

{{< alert icon="👉" >}}
How do cross-source joins work?

The implementation is very basic (and could be dramatically enhanced).
Given a two-source join:

1. `sq` copies the full contents of the left table to the [scratch DB](/docs/concepts/#scratch-db).
1. `sq` copies the full content of the right table to the scratch DB.
1. `sq` executes the query against the scratch DB.

Given that this naive implementation perform a full copy of both tables, cross-source joins
are only suitable for smaller datasets.
{{< /alert >}}

### Ambiguous columns

There are two scenarios where column name ambiguity can cause trouble: in
the query, and in the result set.

The query below selects the `actor_id` column, which exists in both the
`actor` table and the `film_actor` table. The query will fail.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor_id) | .first_name, .actor_id'
sq: ... ERROR: column reference "actor_id" is ambiguous (SQLSTATE 42702)
```

The solution here is to qualify the `.actor_id` column, using either the
table name, or table alias (if specified).

```shell
# Explicitly specify the column's table
$ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor_id) | .first_name, .actor.actor_id'

# Same, but using table alias
$ sq '.actor:a | join(.film_actor, .actor_id) | .first_name, .a.actor_id'
```

If you do want the column values from both tables, you can use a column alias:

```shell
$ sq '.actor:a | join(.film_actor:fa, .actor_id)
| .first_name, .a.actor_id:a_actor, .fa.actor_id:fa_actor'
first_name  a_actor  fa_actor
PENELOPE    1        1
```

What happens if you don't use a column alias?

```shell
$ sq '.actor:a | join(.film_actor:fa, .actor_id) | .first_name, .a.actor_id, .fa.actor_id'
first_name  actor_id  actor_id_1
PENELOPE    1         1
```

`sq` automatically renames duplicate column names in the result set. Thus the
second `actor_id` column becomes `actor_id_1`. This is most frequently seen
when executing a `SELECT * FROM tbl1 JOIN tbl2`: note the `actor_id_1` and
`last_update_1` columns.

```shell
 $ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor_id) | .[0:2]'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update           actor_id_1  film_id  last_update_1
1         PENELOPE    GUINESS    2006-02-15T04:34:33Z  1           1        2006-02-15T05:05:03Z
```

The renaming behavior is configurable via the [`result.column.rename`](/docs/config/#resultcolumnrename)
option.

### Join examples

```shell
# INNER JOIN
$ sq '.actor | join(.film_actor, .actor_id)'

# LEFT JOIN
$ sq '.actor | ljoin(.film_actor, .actor_id)'

# LEFT OUTER JOIN
$ sq '.actor | lojoin(.film_actor, .actor_id)'

# RIGHT JOIN
$ sq '.actor | rjoin(.film_actor, .actor_id)'

# RIGHT OUTER JOIN
$ sq '.actor | rojoin(.film_actor, .actor_id)'

# FULL OUTER JOIN
$ sq '.actor | fojoin(.film_actor, .actor_id)'

# CROSS JOIN
$ sq '.actor | xjoin(.film_actor)'
```

## Functions

### `avg`

`avg` returns the average of all non-null values of the column.

```shell
$ sq '.payment | avg(.amount)'
avg(.amount)
4.2006673312974065
```



### `count`

The no-arg `count` function returns the total number of rows.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | count'
count
200
```

That renders to SQL as:

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS "count" FROM "actor"
```

With an argument, `count(.x)` returns a count of the number of times
that `.x` is not null in a group.

```shell
# count of non-null values in col first_name
$ sq '.actor | count(.first_name)'
```

You can also supply an alias:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | count:quantity'
quantity
200
```

### `count_unique`

`count_unique` counts the unique non-null values of a column.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | count_unique(.first_name)'
count_unique(.first_name)
128
```

### `group_by`

Use `group_by` to [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_by_(SQL)) results.

```shell
$ sq '.payment | .customer_id, sum(.amount) | group_by(.customer_id)'
```

This translates into:

```sql
SELECT "customer_id", sum("amount") FROM "payment" GROUP BY "customer_id"
```

You can use multiple terms in `group_by`:

```shell
$ sq '.payment | .customer_id, .staff_id, sum(.amount) | group_by(.customer_id, .staff_id)'
```

You can also use functions inside `group_by`. For example, to group the payment
amount by month:

```shell
$ sq '.payment | _strftime("%Y/%m", .payment_date), sum(.amount) | group_by(_strftime("%Y/%m", .payment_date))'
strftime('%Y/%m', "payment_date")  sum("amount")
2005/05                            4824.429999999861
2005/06                            9631.87999999961
```

That translates into:

```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y/%m', "payment_date"), sum("amount") FROM "payment"
GROUP BY strftime('%Y/%m', "payment_date")
```

In practice, you probably want to use [column aliases](#column-aliases):

```shell
$ sq '.payment | _strftime("%Y/%m", .payment_date):month, sum(.amount):amount | group_by(.month)'
month    amount
2005/05  4824.429999999861
2005/06  9631.87999999961
```

{{< alert icon="👉" >}}
Note the `_strftime` function in the example above, and in particular note the
leading underscore. That function is
[proprietary](#proprietary-functions)
to [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html): it won't work with Postgres,
MySQL etc. `sq` passes functions through
to the backend, and some of those functions won't be portable to other data sources.

TLDR: Use [proprietary functions](#proprietary-functions) with caution.
{{< /alert >}}

### `max`

`max` returns the maximum value of the column.

```shell
$ sq '.payment | max(.amount)'
max(.amount)
11.99
```

### `min`

`min` returns the minimum non-null value of the column.

```shell
$ sq '.payment | min(.amount)'
min(.amount)
0
```

### `order_by`

Use `order_by` to sort results.

```shell
$ sq '.actor | order_by(.first_name)'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update
71        ADAM        GRANT      2006-02-15T04:34:33Z
132       ADAM        HOPPER     2006-02-15T04:34:33Z
```

This translates to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "actor" ORDER BY "first_name"
```

Change the sort order by appending `+` (ascending) or `-` (descending)
to the column selector:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | order_by(.first_name+, .last_name-)'
actor_id  first_name  last_name  last_update
132       ADAM        HOPPER     2006-02-15T04:34:33Z
71        ADAM        GRANT      2006-02-15T04:34:33Z
```

That query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "actor" ORDER BY "first_name" ASC, "last_name" DESC
```

#### Synonyms

For interoperability with jq, you can use the
[`sort_by`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/v1.6/#sort,sort_by(path_expression))
synonym:

```shell
$ sq '.actor | sort_by(.first_name)'
```

### `sum`

`sum` returns the sum of all non-null values for the column. If there are no
input rows, null is returned.

```shell
$ sq '.payment | sum(.amount)'
sum(.amount)
67416.50999999208
```

### `unique`

`unique` filters results, returning only unique values.

```shell
# Return only unique first names
$ sq '.actor | .first_name | unique'
```

The function maps to the SQL `DISTINCT` keyword:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT "first_name" FROM "actor"
```

## Proprietary functions

The standard functions listed above are all _portable_: that is to say, they
behave (more or less) the same whether the backing DB is Postgres, MySQL, etc.
Portability / compatability is a primary design goal for `sq`. Over time,
it's probable that `sq`'s "standard library" of portable functions will grow.
However, sometimes you simply need to invoke a function that exists only
in Postgres, or SQL Server, etc. To invoke such a function, simply prefix
the proprietary function name with an underscore.

  ```shell
  # SQLite "strftime"
  $ sq '@sakila | .payment | _strftime("%m", .payment_date)'

  # MySQL "date_format"
  $ sq '@sakila/mysql | .payment | _date_format(.payment_date, "%m")'

  # Postgres "date_trunc" func
  $ sq '@sakila/postgres | .payment | _date_trunc("month", .payment_date)'

  # SQL Server "month" func
  $ sq '@sakila | .payment | _month(.payment_date)'
  ```

`sq` can be installed from source, via an install script, or via package managers for various platforms.

## Quick install

Use `install.sh` in most cases other than [Windows](#windows).

```shell
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://sq.io/install.sh)"
```

`install.sh` determines what OS is in use, and attempts to use an appropriate package manager.
The following have been tested:

| Package Manager | OS / Distribution                    | Architecture    |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `apt`           | Debian-based (Ubuntu etc.)           | `arm64` `amd64` |
| `yum`           | RPM-based (Rocky Linux, Fedora etc.) | `arm64` `amd64` |
| `apk`           | Alpine Linux                         | `arm64` `amd64` |
| `pacman`        | Arch Linux                           | `amd64`         |
| `yay`           | Arch Linux                           | `amd64`         |
| `xbps`          | Void Linux                           | `arm64` `amd64` |
| `brew`          | macOS                                | `arm64` `amd64` |
| `brew`          | Linux                                | `arm64`         |

You can view the source for `install.sh` on [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neilotoole/sq/master/install.sh).

## Shell completion

The install packages will generally install shell completion. Note that `sq` provides
extensive completion functionality. If installing from
source, it is highly recommended to manually install shell completion. For instructions:

```shell
sq completion --help
```

## Source

Requires [Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

```shell
go install github.com/neilotoole/sq
```

## Binaries

Pre-built binaries are available from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq/releases).

## macOS

```shell
brew install sq
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" >}}
`sq` is now a [core brew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sq#default). Previously, `sq` was available via `brew install neilotoole/sq/sq`. If you have installed `sq` this way, you should uninstall it (`brew uninstall neilotoole/sq/sq`) before installing the new formula via `brew install sq`.

## Windows

Requires [scoop](http://scoop.sh).

```shell
scoop bucket add sq https://github.com/neilotoole/sq
scoop install sq
```

## Linux

Generally you can use `install.sh`.

```shell
/bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://sq.io/install.sh)"
```

If you need more control over the install,
consult the [install.sh source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neilotoole/sq/master/install.sh).


## Docker

The [`ghcr.io/neilotoole/sq`](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq/pkgs/container/sq)
image is preloaded with `sq` and a handful of related tools like `jq`.

### Local

```shell
# Shell into a one-time container.
$ docker run -it ghcr.io/neilotoole/sq zsh

# Start detached (background) container named "sq-shell".
$ docker run -d --name sq-shell ghcr.io/neilotoole/sq
# Shell into that container.
$ docker exec -it sq-shell zsh
```

### Kubernetes

Running `sq` in a Kubernetes environment is useful for DB migrations,
as well as general data wrangling.

```shell
# Start pod named "sq-shell".
$ kubectl run sq-shell --image ghcr.io/neilotoole/sq
# Shell into the pod.
$ kubectl exec -it sq-shell -- zsh
```



## Upgrade

The `sq version` command reports on whether a new version is available.

```shell
$ sq version
sq v0.32.0    Update available: v0.33.0
```

Note that `sq` is still pre-`v1.0.0`. Occasionally a release introduces a breaking change.

Before upgrading, check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
or the notes for the latest [release](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq/releases).

To upgrade, use the mechanism specific to the package manager for
your system, e.g.:

```shell
brew upgrade sq
```

Usage:
  sq config set shell-completion.group-filter true

When true, shell completion initially suggests only sources within the active
group. When false, all sources are suggested. However, note that if the user
continues to input a source handle that is outside the active group, completion
will suggest all matching sources, regardless of this option's value.
